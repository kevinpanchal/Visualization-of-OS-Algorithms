# Visualization of OS Algorithms
This was a group project where we prepared GUI using Python Tkinter for Page Replacement Algorithms using Bélády's Anomaly. It consists of FIFO, SC, RP, OPR and LIFO. (08/2020 - 12/2020)

Implementation of Page Replacement and Disk Scheduling Algorithms used in Operating Systems.

Includes graphs, comparison, explanation and animation in the GUI.

Technologies used: Python, Tkinter, Matplotlib, NumPy, gTTS
